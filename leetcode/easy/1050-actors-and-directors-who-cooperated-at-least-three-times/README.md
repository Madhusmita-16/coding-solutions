![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Table: `ActorDirector`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

```

 

Write a solution to find all the pairs `(actor_id, director_id)` where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.

Return the result table in  **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
Explanation: The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.
