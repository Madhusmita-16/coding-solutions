# Same Tree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // Both are empty
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }

        // One is empty, the other isn't
        if (p == null || q == null) {
            return false;
        }

        // Values are different
        if (p.val != q.val) {
            return false;
        }

        // Compare left and right subtrees
        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left)
                && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
```
