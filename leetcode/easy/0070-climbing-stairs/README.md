## Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

        if (n <= 2) {
            return n;
        }

        int first = 1;
        int second = 2;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {

            int current = first + second;

            first = second;
            second = current;
        }

        return second;
    }
