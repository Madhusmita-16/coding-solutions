# Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

 

 **Follow up:**  Can you flatten the tree in-place (with `O(1)` extra space)?

class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode current = root;

        while (current != null) {

            if (current.left != null) {
                // Find the rightmost node of the left subtree
                TreeNode predecessor = current.left;

                while (predecessor.right != null) {
                    predecessor = predecessor.right;
                }

                // Connect right subtree after the left subtree
                predecessor.right = current.right;

                // Move left subtree to the right
                current.right = current.left;
                current.left = null;
            }

            // Move to next node
            current = current.right;
        }
    }
}
```
