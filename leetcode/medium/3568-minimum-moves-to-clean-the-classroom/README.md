# Minimum Moves to Clean the Classroom

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` grid `classroom` where a student volunteer is tasked with cleaning up litter scattered around the room. Each cell in the grid is one of the following:

- 'S': Starting position of the student
- 'L': Litter that must be collected (once collected, the cell becomes empty)
- 'R': Reset area that restores the student's energy to full capacity, regardless of their current energy level (can be used multiple times)
- 'X': Obstacle the student cannot pass through
- '.': Empty space

You are also given an integer `energy`, representing the student's maximum energy capacity. The student starts with this energy from the starting position `'S'`.

Each move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) costs 1 unit of energy. If the energy reaches 0, the student can only continue if they are on a reset area `'R'`, which resets the energy to its  **maximum**  capacity `energy`.

Return the  **minimum**  number of moves required to collect all litter items, or `-1` if it's impossible.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  classroom = ["S.", "XL"], energy = 2

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

- The student starts at cell (0, 0) with 2 units of energy.
- Since cell (1, 0) contains an obstacle 'X', the student cannot move directly downward.
- A valid sequence of moves to collect all litter is as follows: Move 1: From (0, 0) → (0, 1) with 1 unit of energy and 1 unit remaining. Move 2: From (0, 1) → (1, 1) to collect the litter 'L'.
- The student collects all the litter using 2 moves. Thus, the output is 2.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  classroom = ["LS", "RL"], energy = 4

 **Output:**  3

 **Explanation:** 

- The student starts at cell (0, 1) with 4 units of energy.
- A valid sequence of moves to collect all litter is as follows: Move 1: From (0, 1) → (0, 0) to collect the first litter 'L' with 1 unit of energy used and 3 units remaining. Move 2: From (0, 0) → (1, 0) to 'R' to reset and restore energy back to 4. Move 3: From (1, 0) → (1, 1) to collect the second litter 'L'.
- The student collects all the litter using 3 moves. Thus, the output is 3.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  classroom = ["L.S", "RXL"], energy = 3

 **Output:**  -1

 **Explanation:** 

No valid path collects all `'L'`.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= m == classroom.length <= 20
- 1 <= n == classroom[i].length <= 20
- classroom[i][j] is one of 'S', 'L', 'R', 'X', or '.'
- 1 <= energy <= 50
- There is exactly one 'S' in the grid.
- There are at most 10 'L' cells in the grid.
