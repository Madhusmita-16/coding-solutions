# Find X Value of Array I

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array of  **positive**  integers `nums`, and a  **positive**  integer `k`.

You are allowed to perform an operation  **once**  on `nums`, where in each operation you can remove any  **non-overlapping**  prefix and suffix from `nums` such that `nums` remains  **non-empty**.

You need to find the  **x-value**  of `nums`, which is the number of ways to perform this operation so that the  **product**  of the remaining elements leaves a  *remainder*  of `x` when divided by `k`.

Return an array `result` of size `k` where `result[x]` is the  **x-value**  of `nums` for `0 <= x <= k - 1`.

A  **prefix**  of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

A  **suffix**  of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array.

 **Note**  that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be  **empty**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3

 **Output:**  [9,2,4]

 **Explanation:** 

- For x = 0, the possible operations include all possible ways to remove non-overlapping prefix/suffix that do not remove nums[2] == 3.
- For x = 1, the possible operations are: Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [2, 3, 4, 5]. nums becomes [1]. Remove the prefix [1, 2, 3] and the suffix [5]. nums becomes [4].
- For x = 2, the possible operations are: Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [3, 4, 5]. nums becomes [1, 2]. Remove the prefix [1] and the suffix [3, 4, 5]. nums becomes [2]. Remove the prefix [1, 2, 3] and the empty suffix. nums becomes [4, 5]. Remove the prefix [1, 2, 3, 4] and the empty suffix. nums becomes [5].

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1,2,4,8,16,32], k = 4

 **Output:**  [18,1,2,0]

 **Explanation:** 

- For x = 0, the only operations that do not result in x = 0 are: Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1, 2]. Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1]. Remove the prefix [1] and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [2].
- For x = 1, the only possible operation is: Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1].
- For x = 2, the possible operations are: Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1, 2]. Remove the prefix [1] and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [2].
- For x = 3, there is no possible way to perform the operation.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 2

 **Output:**  [9,6]

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= k <= 5

```java
class Solution {
    public long[] resultArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        long[] result = new long[k];

        // dp[r] = number of subarrays ending at the previous index
        // whose product % k == r
        long[] dp = new long[k];

        for (int num : nums) {
            long[] next = new long[k];

            int value = num % k;

            // Start a new subarray containing only nums[i]
            next[value]++;

            // Extend every subarray ending at the previous index
            for (int r = 0; r < k; r++) {
                if (dp[r] > 0) {
                    int newRemainder = (int) ((long) r * value % k);
                    next[newRemainder] += dp[r];
                }
            }

            // Every subarray ending here contributes to the answer
            for (int r = 0; r < k; r++) {
                result[r] += next[r];
            }

            dp = next;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
